\usage{
semanalizePNADC(
  data,
  compute_weights = FALSE,
  keep_all = TRUE,
  output = c("crosswalk", "microdata"),
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame or data.table with stacked quarterly PNADC microdata.

For reference week identification only (\code{compute_weights = FALSE}),
minimum required columns are:
\itemize{
\item \code{Ano}, \code{Trimestre}: Year and quarter
\item \code{UPA}, \code{V1008}, \code{V1014}: Primary sampling unit, household, panel
\item \code{V2008}, \code{V20081}, \code{V20082}: Birth day, month, year
\item \code{V2009}: Age
}

For weekly weight computation (\code{compute_weights = TRUE}), additional
columns are required. See Details.}

\item{compute_weights}{Logical. If TRUE, compute weekly adjusted survey weights in
addition to identifying reference weeks. Default is FALSE. Requires the
\code{sidrar} package to fetch population data from IBGE SIDRA API.
Note: Weekly weights are interpolated from monthly SIDRA data (Table 6022)
because IBGE does not publish official weekly population estimates.}

\item{keep_all}{Logical. If TRUE (default), return all rows from input data,
with \code{weight_weekly = NA} for observations where reference week
could not be determined. If FALSE, only return observations with
determined reference weeks (smaller output). Only applies when
\code{compute_weights = TRUE}.}

\item{output}{Character. What to return:
\itemize{
\item \code{"crosswalk"} (default): Minimal crosswalk for joining
\item \code{"microdata"}: Full microdata with all computed columns
}}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print progress messages? Default TRUE.}
}
\value{
Depends on \code{output} parameter:

If \code{output = "crosswalk"} (default):
A data.table with join keys and new time variables:
\itemize{
\item Join keys: \code{Ano}, \code{Trimestre}, \code{UPA}, \code{V1008}, \code{V1014}, \code{V2003}
\item \code{ref_week}: Reference week as Date (Monday of that week)
\item \code{ref_week_in_quarter}: Week position in quarter (1-14) or NA
\item \code{ref_week_iso_yyyyww}: Integer YYYYWW format (ISO year-week)
\item \code{weight_weekly}: Weekly weight (if \code{compute_weights = TRUE})
}

If \code{output = "microdata"}:
Full input data with all computed columns added.
}
\description{
This function processes stacked quarterly PNADC microdata to:
\enumerate{
\item Identify which ISO 8601 week each observation refers to
\item Optionally compute weekly adjusted survey weights (if \code{compute_weights = TRUE})
}

The output is a crosswalk table that can be joined with original (stacked or unstacked)
PNADC data files to add weekly time information.
}
\details{
Main function to convert quarterly PNADC survey data to weekly time series.
Returns a crosswalk data.frame for joining with original data, adding
reference week information and optionally weekly survey weights.
\subsection{Reference Week Identification}{

The algorithm determines which ISO 8601 week each survey response refers to based on:
\itemize{
\item IBGE's "Parada Tecnica" rules for reference week timing
\item Respondent birthdates (constrains possible interview dates)
\item Household-level aggregation (all persons in same household interviewed same day)
}
}

\subsection{Household Aggregation}{

Unlike monthly identification (which aggregates by UPA-V1014 across all quarters),
weekly identification aggregates by household (UPA + V1008) WITHIN each quarter.
This is because:
\itemize{
\item All persons in the same household are interviewed on the same day
\item Households ARE interviewed in the same month across quarterly visits
\item BUT they are NOT interviewed in the same week across quarterly visits
}
}

\subsection{Expected Determination Rate}{

The determination rate for weeks (~50-75\%) is lower than for months (~97\%) because:
\itemize{
\item Cannot aggregate constraints across quarters (no cross-quarter week consistency)
\item Finer granularity (13-14 weeks vs 3 months per quarter)
}

Household aggregation improves the rate compared to individual-level processing.
}

\subsection{ISO 8601 Weeks}{

Weeks follow the ISO 8601 standard:
\itemize{
\item Week 1 is the week containing January 4th
\item Weeks start on Monday
\item December 31 may be in week 1 of the following year
\item January 1-3 may be in week 52/53 of the previous year
}
}

\subsection{Weekly Weight Computation}{

When \code{compute_weights = TRUE}, the function:
\enumerate{
\item Fetches monthly population from IBGE SIDRA API (table 6022)
\item Distributes monthly population equally across weeks in each month
\item Applies hierarchical rake weighting to adjust individual weights
}

\strong{Important:} Weekly weights are derived from monthly SIDRA data because IBGE
does not publish official weekly population estimates. The weekly population
targets are approximations.

Additional required columns for weight computation:
\itemize{
\item Survey design: \code{V1028}, \code{V1008}, \code{V2003}, \code{UF}, \code{posest}, \code{posest_sxi}
}
}
}
\section{Dependencies}{

When \code{compute_weights = TRUE}, the \code{sidrar} package is required
to fetch population data. Install with: \code{install.packages("sidrar")}
}

# Basic usage: identify reference weeks only

# Use weight_weekly for weekly aggregates
