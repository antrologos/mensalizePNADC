\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame or data.table with PNADC microdata. Required columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{Ano}: Survey year
\item \code{Trimestre}: Quarter (1-4)

}}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE (default), display progress information.}

\item{.pb}{Optional progress bar object.}

\item{.pb_offset}{Integer. Offset for progress bar updates.}
}
\value{
A data.table with the original key columns plus:
\itemize{
\item \code{ref_fortnight_start}: Reference fortnight start (Sunday of first IBGE week)
\item \code{ref_fortnight_end}: Reference fortnight end (Saturday of last IBGE week)
\item \code{ref_fortnight_in_quarter}: Position in quarter (1-6) or NA
\item \code{ref_fortnight_yyyyff}: Integer YYYYFF format (1-24 per year)
\item \code{ref_fortnight_weeks}: Number of IBGE weeks in this fortnight (2 or 3)
}
}
\description{
PNADC is a quarterly survey where each interview occurs during a specific
fortnight within the quarter. This function identifies which IBGE fortnight
(1-6 per quarter, 1-24 per year) that observation belongs to, enabling
bi-weekly time series analysis.

The algorithm uses:
\itemize{
\item IBGE's reference week timing rules (first Saturday with sufficient days in month)
\item IBGE week boundaries (Sunday-Saturday, not calendar days)
\item Respondent birthdates to constrain possible interview dates
\item Household-level aggregation within quarter (all persons in same household interviewed on same day)
\item Dynamic exception detection (identifies quarters needing relaxed rules)
}
}
\details{
Determines which IBGE fortnight (quinzena) within each quarter corresponds
to each survey observation based on IBGE's interview timing rules.
\subsection{IBGE Fortnight Definition}{

IBGE fortnights are based on IBGE reference weeks, NOT calendar days:
\itemize{
\item Fortnight 1 of a month = IBGE weeks 1-2 of that month
\item Fortnight 2 of a month = IBGE weeks 3-4 (or 3-5 for 5-week months)
}

Each quarter has 6 fortnights (2 per month).
}

\subsection{Expected Determination Rate}{

Fortnight determination rate is typically low (~2-5\%) because:
\itemize{
\item Unlike months, fortnights cannot aggregate across quarters
\item Birthday constraints typically narrow the date range by only a few weeks
\item An IBGE fortnight (2 weeks) is difficult to pinpoint without cross-quarter data
}

The algorithm determines fortnight when the interview date range falls
entirely within a single IBGE fortnight (weeks 1-2 or weeks 3+).

\strong{Note}: The month algorithm achieves ~97\% determination by aggregating
at UPA-V1014 level across ALL quarters (leveraging the panel design where
the same units are interviewed in consistent relative positions). Fortnights
and weeks cannot use this cross-quarter aggregation because their positions
are not consistent across panel visits.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Identify reference fortnights
result <- identify_reference_fortnight(pnadc_data)

# Check determination rate by quarter
result[, .(
  total = .N,
  determined = sum(!is.na(ref_fortnight_in_quarter)),
  rate = mean(!is.na(ref_fortnight_in_quarter))
), by = .(Ano, Trimestre)]

# Note: Fortnight determination rate is typically low (~2-5\%)
# because fortnights cannot aggregate across quarters like months can.
