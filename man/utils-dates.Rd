\title{Date Utility Functions}
\description{
Internal helper functions for date calculations. Optimized with
pre-computed lookup tables for fast date creation (~20x faster than ISOdate).

This file includes:
\itemize{
\item Fast date creation with lookup tables (make_date)
\item ISO 8601 week utilities (Monday-Sunday weeks)
\item IBGE reference calendar utilities (Sunday-Saturday weeks)
}
}
\section{IBGE Reference Calendar}{

The IBGE reference calendar differs from ISO 8601:
\itemize{
\item Weeks start on Sunday and end on Saturday
\item A week belongs to the IBGE month where its Saturday falls
\item The first valid Saturday must have >= 4 days (or 3 as exception) in the month
\item IBGE months can have 4 or 5 reference weeks
}
}
