Description: Identifies reference periods (months, fortnights, and weeks) in
    Brazil's quarterly PNADC (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicilios
    Continua) survey data and computes calibrated weights for sub-quarterly
    analysis. The core algorithm uses IBGE's "Parada Técnica" (technical break)
    rules combined with respondent birthdates to determine which temporal period
    each survey observation refers to. Period identification follows a nested
    hierarchy enforced by construction: fortnights require months, weeks require
    fortnights. Achieves ~97% monthly determination rate when using stacked
    multi-quarter data. Strict fortnight and week rates are lower (~6% and ~1.5%
    respectively) as they cannot leverage cross-quarter panel aggregation.
    Experimental strategies (probabilistic assignment and UPA aggregation) can
    boost fortnight rates to ~27% and week rates to ~2%. The package provides
    adaptive hierarchical weight calibration (4/2/1 cell levels for month/
    fortnight/week) with period-specific smoothing to produce survey weights
    calibrated to IBGE SIDRA population totals.
